# Mymz World Child Care – Website Project (Case Study)

This repository is a case study of a real website project I collaborated on with my cousin, an experienced web developer, for my mum’s childcare business, *Mymz World*.  
This repo documents **my contributions**, the content I helped organise, and what I learned during the project.

## 📌 Project Overview
Mymz World Child Care is a professional childcare service focused on education, safety, and development.  
The website includes sections such as:

- Home

I worked alongside my cousin to help prepare website content, review page layouts, and understand how websites are structured.
